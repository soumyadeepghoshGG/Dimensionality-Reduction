# Dimensionality Reduction
 Dimensionality reduction is a crucial technique in machine learning and data science that involves reducing the number of features or variables in a dataset while retaining its essential information. As datasets grow in complexity with a large number of features, the curse of dimensionality becomes a challenge, leading to increased computational costs, overfitting, and reduced model interpretability. By eliminating redundant or less informative features, dimensionality reduction not only enhances computational efficiency but also mitigates the risk of overfitting, improves model generalization, and aids in visualizing data patterns. This process plays a pivotal role in enhancing the performance and interpretability of machine learning models, making them more applicable to real-world scenarios where datasets often exhibit high dimensionality.

## Introduction
The `FeatureReducer` class is a flexible tool for feature reduction in machine learning and data analysis. It supports multiple methods, allowing users to choose the most suitable approach for their specific dataset.

## Installation
To run the project, you'll need to have the following Python packages installed. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Class Parameters
The Feature Reducer class has the following parameters:

-   **method (str):** The reduction method to be applied (default is 'pca').
-   **no_of_final_features (int):** The desired number of final features after reduction (default is None).
-   **kbest_score_func (str):** The scoring function for Select K-Best method (default is 'f_classif').
-   **plots (bool):** Whether to generate plots during reduction (default is False).
-   **threshold (dict):** Dictionary of thresholds for different reduction methods (default values provided).

For additional information about the `method` and `thresholds` parameters:
```bash
print(FeatureReducer.methods.available())    # See available methods

print(FeatureReducer.thresholds.description()) # See possible thresholds
```

## Methods
The Feature Reducer supports the following reduction methods:

-   **Missing Value Filter:** Removes features with missing values above a specified threshold.
-   **Low Variance Filter:** Filters out features with variance below a given threshold.
-   **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** Projects the data onto a lower-dimensional subspace.
-   **Factor Analysis:** Models observed variables as linear combinations of underlying factors.
-   **Select K-Best:** Selects the top k features based on statistical tests.
-   **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF):** Identifies and removes features with high multicollinearity.
-   **Backward Feature Elimination:** Eliminates features using backward elimination.
-   **Forward Feature Elimination:** Selects features using forward elimination based on f-values.
-   **Lasso Regression:** Applies Lasso regression for feature selection.
-   **Random Forest:** Uses Random Forest for feature importance and selection.

## Examples
Here's a quick example of using the Feature Reducer:
```bash
from AutomateDimensionalityReduction import FeatureReducer
# Create an instance of FeatureReducer 
foo = FeatureReducer(method='factor_analysis')
# Assuming you have your feature matrix X and target variable y
X_reduced = foo.reduce_features(X, y)
```
